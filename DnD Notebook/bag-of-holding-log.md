# Bag of Holding
## General Information
### Main Details
- 70 cubic ft capacity
- Bag of Holding 3
  - (x2) Bag of Holdings that are stuck together 
### Side Details
- Has two `pockets` that make it easier for hiding items as needed.
  - `Left` pocket is for '_legal goods_'.
  - `Right` pocket is for '_for smooglin_'
- [`Pignut`](../Images/Companions%20&%20Pals/Companions/Pignut.png) lives in the bag of holding now.
  - Uses a pipe as an air straw in order to survive.
  - His _'toilet'_ needs to be emptied every so often.
  - He needs toilet paper as well or items will be destroyed or go '_missing_'.

**Pignut for Reference:**

- Assume we will always show just the left side of the bag of holding to security.
