## Overview
**Previous Session Recap:**
- Just after the battle of the angle with the trumpet with tentacles was finished in the Black.
- Still at battle location / not at camp.

**Session Actions Taken:**
- Brought the corpse of the angel / tentacle mess to just outside of the camp for investigating (primarily to make sure it doesn't rise up and to see if it had any markings to the angels). 
- Body of the angel is looked at with the assistance of clerics and team. Information in Session [Corpse Information](#corpse-information).
- Had BodnÃ¡r Norbert (General for the Geistwatch army) get the clerics out of the way.
- Dissections on angel corpse performed and items received. Details in: [Corpse Dissection](#corpse-dissection-).
- Clerics blamed each other for the trumpet being missing -> lie from Alabaster and Taurus for sleeping on watch. 
- Pignut saves the day / solidify lie but bag of holding full of shit and needs cleaning. 
- Gobrian and family still safe and traveled

## Session Details

- **Identification:**
	- NOT the angel of death BUT, probably were under them though
- **Additional Information:** 
	- The corpse of an angel SHOULD return back to its own plane. 
	- Something is keeping it / has been keeping it on the material plane.
