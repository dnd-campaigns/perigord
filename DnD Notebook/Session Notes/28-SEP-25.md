_Plan_ 
> [!Note]
> Taurus opens the Warrior Door again for Hallamir after around 5 mins of not hearing anything. Hallamir comes back and relays the information. Hallamir is by the cow door with Taurus. Helra goes through the Warrior door to activate the cow pressure plate in the snek door. Alabaster opens the warrior door via the spike room. Leeve and Harim still at the pressure plates in the first area. 

- Once Helra opens the cow, the spikes do not move but opens the door for Hallamir and Taurus. 
- Tiny room for cow room for Hallamir and Taurus

- Helra preps for any remaining skulls to charge down

- Taurus meets up to Helra tells them that Hallamir is on the skull plate and can go off
- Decide that I'll just stay on here and Taurus can go up and check out the skull plate room and not touch anything yet until the imp can update everyone
- Taurus ends up pressing the hand plate and Hallamir can exit off the skull plate
- Helra mets up to Alabaster and we all meet at the main location with the bridge
- Offer another gold coin to the priest 
  - Helra (-1 gold)
- Go by the hand door
- Enter the hand door (everyone together)
