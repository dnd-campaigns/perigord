  - Everyone does this
  - Statues state we can proceed

#### Right Area
- 2 stone slaps 
- Nothing of note / depicts of the temple

#### Middle Area
- Bridge with symbols
  - Eye, Foot, Arrow
- Goes over a pit 
  - Very deep / into acid (Allabaster chucks a stone)
- Two Snek statues on either side with their mouth open 
- Lever inside of their mouths
  - Once pulled -> something is rumbleded / something is moved 
  - Requires both to be pulled and they release once released

---------------------

### Cyclop In-Between Room
There is a depiction of a warrior on the north wall. There are 4 pillars in the room. Hallamir checks them out / bit have something inside them or something hidden. If you touch them, something bad will happen. (Alabaster checks them out). Can be dispelled potentially for the disable device or dispell magick.

- Hallamir gives it a go / 250 gold piece ruby obtained (Hallamir) (Pillar 1)
- Pillar 2- cannot see where it is
- Pillar 3- cannot see where it is
- Pillar 4- can see it / very easy / chipped 
  - Pulls it out -> Hallamir


![](../../Images/Maps/BattleMaps/bone-zone/cyclops-2.png)

#### North
- Warrior Depiction 
- Abjuration Magick
  - Weak 1-3 level

#### South 
- Hidden wall that can open out to the bottom right
  - Taurus and Alabaster pressing on the tiles / slabs
  - Requires someone to be on there for the hidden wall to be opened
- There is a spike wall at the top in it
- Warrior wall opens up when the statue in the hidden room is touched
  - Spiked wall starts to come down in that time period though
  - When let go -> warrior room closes back 

- Leeve and Harim move to press the slabs instead for keeping the hidden wall 
- Taurus to go into the hidden spike room and touch the statue
- Hallamir to quickly search the warrior room 
- Taurus to let go once Hallamir is in

#### Warrior Room 
- 3 doors
- Snek that is open
- Monkey door that is closed
- Warrior door (just walked through) / closed
- Hallamir walks through the snek door

#### Snek Door
- There is a fork in the road
- Center of the hall:
  - Right there is a wall of spike with a plate on the floor 
    - Picture of a cow
  - End of the hallway: Skull with a skull with gems for eyes

_Plan_ 
> [!Note]
> Taurus opens the Warrior Door again for Hallamir after around 5 mins of not hearing anything. Hallamir comes back and relays the information. Hallamir is by the cow door with Taurus. Helra goes through the Warrior door to activate the cow pressure plate in the snek door. Alabaster opens the warrior door via the spike room. Leeve and Harim still at the pressure plates in the first area. 

- Once Helra opens the cow, the spikes do not move but opens the door for Hallamir and Taurus. 
- Tiny room for cow room for Hallamir and Taurus
  - Skull pressure plate in there

> [!Warning]
> Helra hears a scream in the area she is in down the hallway? (which?) INIT roll for everyone but Helra is the only one that hears it. 

- Skull with gem eyes is flying down the hall towards Helra
- Helra preps to attack / doesn't want to move off the pressure plate
- Alabaster hears the screams and sends of his imp
- Taurus goes walking to tell everyone else that we found the skull plate
- Hallamir steps on the skull plate
- Taurus keeps walking
- Helra preps for any remaining skulls to charge down
- Imp comes back 
- Taurus meets up to Helra tells them that Hallamir is on the skull plate and can go off
- Decide that I'll just stay on here and Taurus can go up and check out the skull plate room and not touch anything yet until the imp can update everyone
- Taurus ends up pressing the hand plate and Hallamir can exit off the skull plate
- Helra mets up to Alabaster and we all meet at the main location with the bridge
- Offer another gold coin to the priest 
  - Helra (-1 gold)
- Go by the hand door
- Enter the hand door (everyone together)

![](../../Images/Maps/BattleMaps/bone-zone/cyclops-1.png)

_Small cow door if that was closed while someone was in it would have killed them with lack of air..._
 
- Warrior spike secret door
  - Needs two people by the slabs to have that door open
- Spike Secret door opens Warrior door
- Snek door opens with the snek levers being pulled at the bridge
- Cow door opens with the cow button pressed that is behind the warrior / snek door
- Skull door opened by the skull pressure plate in the cow room 
- Skull room has the hand pressure plate to open the hand door
- Monkey room unknown
